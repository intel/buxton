- make install: create some default data path

- integrate smack access control in get_value and set_value functions
  of bt-daemon (main.c)

- don't hang for clients in bt-daemon, possible solution is to set
  socket timeout when we have a partial message, then remove timeout
  once a complete message is recieved.

- test multi-part messaging in the client-side of the library, mirroring
  changes made to bt-daemon's protocol handling

- add checks for data consistency, and determine if gdbm needs to be
  "reorganised" to ensure minimal I/O bottlenecking

- verify that received strings over the socket have a \x00 at the last
  byte just to assure that it's not utter garbage.
